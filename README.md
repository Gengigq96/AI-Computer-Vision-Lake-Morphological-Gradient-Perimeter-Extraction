# AI-Computer-Vision-Lake-Morphological-Gradient-Perimeter-Extraction
extract the perimeter of a lake during a drought period (after 4 years) from satellite images using morphological gradient calculations. The goal is to explore image processing techniques and apply them to satellite imagery to study changes in the lake's perimeter over time, especially in drought conditions.
